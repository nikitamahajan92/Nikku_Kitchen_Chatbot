# Nikku_Kitchen_Chatbot

**This repository contains an end-to-end project for a food delivery website with an integrated chatbot built using Dialogflow. The project covers the following aspects:**

**Dialogflow Basics**: Setting up intents and entities for the chatbot to handle user interactions effectively.
**Backend Development**: Implementing the backend in Python using FastAPI to process requests and manage order data.
**Database Integration**: Connecting to a MySQL database to store and retrieve order details.
**ngrok Setup**: Using ngrok to expose the local server to the internet for webhook integrations with Dialogflow.
**Frontend Development**: Creating a user-friendly website using HTML and CSS.

**Delivery Process**

The chatbot supports the following delivery processes:

**Placing a New Order:** Users can interact with the chatbot to place new orders by specifying their desired food items. The chatbot captures the order details and processes them through the backend, storing them in the MySQL database.

**Tracking an Order:** Users can inquire about the status of their existing orders. The chatbot retrieves the order status from the database and provides updates to the user.


This comprehensive project demonstrates how to build a fully functional chatbot for a food delivery service, from user interaction to order processing, tracking, and data management.
